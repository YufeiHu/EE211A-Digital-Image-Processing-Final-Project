# EE211A-Digital-Image-Processing-Final-Project
Real-time Face Swap System based on Autoencoder

### 1/25:
The source codes for the original face-swapping project is found [here](https://github.com/joshua-wu/deepfakes_faceswap/).
The codes and data are downloaded and tested on my laptop. Everything is working pretty well.
